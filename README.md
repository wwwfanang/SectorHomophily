# Sector_Homophily

This repository contains data and codes we used in support of our work "Sector Homophily Levels in Vocational Networks Across 20 Years".

This project provides the dataset of mobility network structure, network community, and companies with GICS code. In order to protect the privacy, the companies' name are all hashed by sha256. And also provides the code of the main figures in our paper.

Data can be found in "Releases-Data". The file "CompanyLink.csv" is the link between two companies. File "Company_Community_Louvain.csv" is the community number of each company based on Louvain. File "Company_Sector_Community.csv" is the GICS code for each company.

The rest of the R codes can correspond to the figures in the paper according to the file name.
